DC-VIRTCD
=========

DC-VIRTCD is a CD virtualization system for the Dreamcast.  It allows you
to run software which accesses files on CD-ROM, without actually burning
those files on a CD-ROM.  Instead, the files are accessed over the network.
This happens transparantly, without any modifications having to be made
to the software itself.

Requirements
------------

* Broadband adapter
* A computer to run the host side of the application on
* A network cable
